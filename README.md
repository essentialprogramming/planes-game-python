### Planes Game
A console-based version of the beloved [game of Planes](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avioane_(joc)) using Python 3 and domain driven design.

## Play the game

  The game will be played on an 8x8 board numbered A-H (columns) and 1-8 (lines). Each player will place 2 planes having the shape as illustrated in the link above. The computer places its planes randomly. The program will prevent both players from placing planes that are outside the playing area or which overlap.
To help the player, the game will display both the player’s grid as well as its “targeting” grid, that contains information about the player’s ‘hits’ and ‘misses’.
